# 🔍 Digital Forensics Experiment – Sleuth Kit (Ex. No. 6)

---

## 🎯 Aim
To analyze a forensic disk image using **The Sleuth Kit (TSK)** and extract file system information, partitions, and deleted files.

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later  
- **Tool:** The Sleuth Kit v4.14.0  
- **Image Files:**  
  - `4Dell Latitude CPi.E01`  
  - `4Dell Latitude CPi.E02`  
- **Mounting Tool:** OSFMount (to create Local Disk E:)

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🪟 Step 1 — Install Sleuth Kit
Download and extract Sleuth Kit for Windows:
```
https://sleuthkit.org/
```
Extract or install to:
```
C:\Users\krthc\Downloads\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32
```

### 💽 Step 2 — Mount the E01 Image
Use **OSFMount**:
1. Open OSFMount → Click **“Mount New”**
2. Select:
   ```
   4Dell Latitude CPi.E01
   ```
   *(Keep `.E02` in the same folder — it will auto-detect.)*
3. Choose:
   - **Mount entire image as read-only**
   - **Assign drive letter E:**
4. Click **Mount**

After mounting, verify “Local Disk (E:)” appears in File Explorer.

## 🧩 Analysis Using Sleuth Kit

### ⚙️ Step 1 — Open Command Prompt as Administrator
```
cd "C:\Users\krthc\Downloads\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32\bin"
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2 — Analyze File System
```
fsstat \\.\E: > fsinfo.txt
```
**Description:**  
Extracts file system information (volume name, sector size, cluster info, timestamps).

---

### 🔹 Step 3 — List Partition Table
```
mmls \\.\E: > partitions.txt
```
**Description:**  
Displays partition layout and offsets.

---

### 🔹 Step 4 — List All Files (Including Deleted)
```
fls -r \\.\E: > filelist.txt
```
**Description:**  
Recursively lists all files and directories.  
Deleted files are marked with an asterisk `*`.

---

### 🔹 Step 5 — Recover a Deleted File (Optional)
If a deleted file (e.g., inode `128`) is found in `filelist.txt`, use:

```
icat \\.\E: 128 > recovered.jpg
istat \\.\E: 128 > metadata.txt
```

**Output:**
- `recovered.jpg` → the recovered deleted file  
- `metadata.txt` → inode information and timestamps (Modified, Accessed, Changed, Created)

---

## 📁 Output Files

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `fsinfo.txt` | Detailed file system report |
| `partitions.txt` | Partition structure and sector offsets |
| `filelist.txt` | Recursive file and directory listing |
| `recovered.jpg` | Recovered deleted evidence file |
| `metadata.txt` | Metadata of the recovered file |

All outputs are generated and saved inside:
```
C:\Users\krthc\Downloads\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32\bin
```

## 🧠 Understanding the Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **fsstat** | Displays file system details |
| **mmls** | Lists partitions within a disk image |
| **fls** | Lists files, including deleted ones |
| **icat** | Extracts file content by inode |
| **istat** | Displays metadata information |

---

## ✅ Result
The `.E01 E02` forensic image was successfully mounted as a virtual disk (E:) and analyzed using The Sleuth Kit.  
File system details, partitions, and deleted files were extracted and recovered, demonstrating digital evidence analysis using open-source forensic tools.
